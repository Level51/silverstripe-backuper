# Backuper - A SilverStripe backup module
**Backuper** is a slick backup module for SilverStripe. It just gets a database dump and packs it with all files in the assets/ directory as .zip archive. Great for migration of pages through easy-to-use import/export functionality in the *Settings* section of the CMS.
