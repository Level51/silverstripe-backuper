For nginx have a look at: https://easyengine.io/tutorials/php/increase-file-upload-size-limit/
* For Google Drive Backup functionality: Make sure that the plugin can store and delete an accesstoken in a textfile located in the **_config** folder. Hence, user www-data requires **full** file permissions for the plugin's _config folder. Run: ```chown www-data _config && chmod 700 _config```
